# Basic_Bank_Account

The "Account" project is a Java-based implementation that models a basic bank account using object-oriented programming concepts. It demonstrates the structure of a simple banking application where users can create an account, deposit money, and withdraw funds while managing account details. The project primarily focuses on encapsulation and basic interactions with a bank account.
# Project Overview

The Account class represents a bank account and encapsulates the following properties:

- **Number**: The account number.
- **Balance**: The current account balance.
- **Name**: The account holder's name.
